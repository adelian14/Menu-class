# Menu-class

This project provides a class that simplifies creating console applications with interactive menus by managing the complexities of menu display and control, enabling developers to focus entirely on their application’s functionality.

```cpp
cout << "here\n";
MenuItem* mainMenu = new MenuItem();
mainMenu->addItem("Calculator");
mainMenu->addItem("String");
mainMenu->addItem("Array");
```
